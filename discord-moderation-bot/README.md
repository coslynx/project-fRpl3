## Features
- **Welcome message:** Send a customized welcome message to new members joining the server.
- **Auto-moderation:** Automatically moderate messages for spam, offensive language, and other violations.
- **Kick and ban:** Ability to kick or ban users who are not following the server rules.
- **Mute:** Mute users who are causing disruptions in the chat.
- **Warn:** Issue warnings to users who violate rules before taking further action.
- **Logging:** Log all moderation actions taken by the bot for transparency.
- **Custom commands:** Allow server admins to set custom commands for the bot to execute.

## Enhancements
- **User-friendly interface:** Create an easy-to-use dashboard for server admins to configure bot settings.
- **Role management:** Implement a feature for the bot to manage user roles based on certain criteria.
- **Message filtering:** Add advanced message filtering options to catch more types of inappropriate content.
- **Timed actions:** Enable timed actions such as temporary bans or mutes for specific durations.
- **Integration:** Integrate with other discord bots or services to enhance functionality.

## Programming Languages
- **Python:** Using Python for its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support for discord bots.

## APIs
- **Discord API:** To interact with the Discord platform, manage server events, and perform moderation actions.

## Packages and Libraries
- **discord.py (version 1.7.3):** A Python library for creating discord bots, providing easy integration with the Discord API.
- **asyncio (version 3.4.3):** For handling asynchronous tasks efficiently, essential for managing multiple discord events simultaneously.

## Rationale
- **Python:** Chosen for its readability and simplicity, making it easier to develop and maintain the bot code.
- **discord.py:** Ideal for creating discord bots, offering a high-level API for interacting with the Discord platform.
- **asyncio:** Necessary for handling multiple discord events concurrently, ensuring the bot can respond promptly to user actions.
